# Image Recognition using pretrained ResNet50 Network

ResNet-50 is a deep residual network. The “50” refers to the number of layers it has. It’s a subclass of convolutional neural networks, with ResNet most popularly used for image classification.

The main innovation of ResNet is the skip connection. As you know, without adjustments, deep networks often suffer from vanishing gradients, ie: as the model backpropagates, the gradient gets smaller and smaller. Tiny gradients can make learning intractable.
